# 6.03 Activity 2

In this activity we will work with the same tableau workbook (used for `sample_superstore.xls` file). You should have this file since it was used the lesson 2 activities.

- For each city in a state, we want to see how that city is doing compared to all the other cities in that state. We will compare the total profits (sum of profits) using `FIXED` and `EXCLUDE`.
- Create a calculated field where we will fix (using `FIXED` keyword) the state and compute the total profits, as shown below:
  { FIXED [State]: SUM([Profit])}
- Create another calculated field we will use the `EXCLUDE` keyword to exclude the city from the sum of profit, as shown below:
  { EXCLUDE [City] : SUM([Profit])}
- For each state, and for each city in the state compare the profit of the city vs. the total profit of that state.
- Do you see any difference between the values for calculated fields created using keywords, `FIXED` and `EXCLUDE`?
